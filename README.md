# fileManager
Simple application to upload and manage files.

The File Manager application is self contained and located in wwwroot/module.  It is designed as a stand alone module that can be downloaded as is and dropped into a sub-folder of your application.

The rest of the files in the wwwroot directory show an example of loading and using the File Manager application.

The SQL files in the "db" folder will need to be run for the database storage to work.
